# The starting point for this task is the module lab6_passengers, that is,
# the Passenger class and its subclasses BusinessPassenger and EconomyPassenger.
# Your task is to create functions for
# - serialising (writing) objects of the class Passenger and its subclasses
#   into a .json file
# - deserializing (reconstructing) objects of the class Passenger and its subclasses
#   from a .json file (created using the previous function)
