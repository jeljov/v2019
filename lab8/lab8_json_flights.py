# The starting point for this task is the module lab6_flight, that is, the Flight class.
# Note that one attribute of this class is a list of flight passengers, that is, a list
# of objects of the class Passenger and/or its subclasses BusinessPassenger and
# EconomyPassenger defined in the module lab6_passengers.
# In addition, one attribute (departure) is of the datetime.datetime type.
# Your task is to create functions for
# - serialising (writing) objects of the class Flight into a .json file
# - deserializing (reconstructing) objects of the class Flight from a
#   .json file (created using the previous function)
